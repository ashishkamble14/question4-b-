# question4-b-
This respo contains the code for question 4(b) of SCITOOLBOX
The description of each and every programming details have been mentioned in the code in the form of comments
The given code has been tested with ATmega16 chip and CP2102 module for uart communication
The serial monitor of arduino ide was used to see the message been sent by atmega16
After burning the code it was observed that atmega calculated the 10 bit adc value of analog input of potentiometer and transmited the value to computer using the defined uart function accurately.
The values were displayed on serial monitor of arduino ide
Please read the details mentioned in comments in code
